Once again, the camera angle changes to capture the back of a woman swaying, as well as the sea of people in front of her moving in unison.` },

He falls downward, and as the camera angle shifts to a low angle shot, a woman is seen holding the stick at the mouth of a well. The old man falls down into the well, and the camera then switches to the well's opening, where the woman gives a smile.

The video almost exclusively captures the person's shadow and the movement of the ball. Then, the camera gradually moves upward from the feet, sequentially showing the lower legs, knees, thighs clad in black shorts, hands, and the upper body dressed in a blue T-shirt. Meanwhile, the person continues to juggle the ball with alternating left and right feet. Just before the video ends, the individual turns their back to the camera and flicks the ball with the lower leg.` },
